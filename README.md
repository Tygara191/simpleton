# simpleton

**_What this is:_** This is a basis for a very simple php project. It is designed and written with 2 concepts in mind: simple-to-use, powerful enough to help most common web development tasks in one way or another. It is built with the intention to be easy for newbie php developers to use, while providing solutions to common web development problems.

**_What this is NOT:_** This is not intended to be a full fledged framework and while yes, it can be used as a basis for big web apps, that is far from its intention.
